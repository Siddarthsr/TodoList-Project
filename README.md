TODOLIST PROJECT

 

Run the index.html file on your browser, to see the output on the browser

It uses jquery, css, javascript, bootstrap and html

The javascript library is downloaded and stored in the assests file and then it is included in the header of the index.html file

And bootstrap is included as cdn in the index.html file.

For fonts I have used google fonts which is also included in the header of the index.html file.

Also have a look at the todos.css file.
